# Noteful 
Noteful lets users manage and organize their notes, which are stored on an external server. 

## Motivation
This was created to practice developing and thinking in React, including unit testing and tying the app to a backend server (see here: https://github.com/omaiyea/noteful-server)

## Built With
React, Enzyme, CSS, JavaScript

## Screenshots
#### View notes within a given folder:
Note: This is similar to the inital home view, which shows all notes regardless of folder

#### View the contents of a note:

## Future Enhancements
* Data loaded from sample file so app works without server setup
* Better formatting on mobile (app is responsive but not optimized for mobile - especially the Add Note / Add Folder windows)
