# Noteful 
Noteful lets users manage and organize their notes, which are stored on an external server. 

## Motivation
This was created to practice developing and thinking in React, including unit testing and tying the app to a backend server (see here: https://github.com/omaiyea/noteful-server)

## Built With
Front end: React, Enzyme, CSS

Back end: Node, Chai, Mocha, Supertest

## Screenshots
#### View notes within a given folder:
Note: This is similar to the inital home view, which shows all notes regardless of folder

## Future App Enhancements
* Better formatting on mobile (app is responsive but not optimized for mobile - especially the Add Note / Add Folder windows)
* Hook up delete folder endpoint to the app so users can delete folders
